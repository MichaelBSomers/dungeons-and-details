### Docs

This App uses React Functional Components - A Functional component is a function that takes props and returns JSX. They do not have state or lifecycle methods. Functional components are easier to read, debug, and test. They offer performance benefits, decreased coupling, and greater reusability.

Component Lifecycle Methods - Mounting / Updating / Unmounting / Error Handling.
https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html

This App will be using hooks to interact with the component lifecycle method instead of the component life cycle methods.
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html

This App will be using useState to interact with the state of components.
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate

This App will use useContext & useReducer to handle global state.
